# Mobile Development Setup

## Objective

Mobile development demands more computational resources compared to web development. To ensure a smooth development experience, we will be using the Expo Framework for React Native, which simplifies mobile app development and testing.

To successfully complete this task, ensure you have the following:

- Node.js LTS installed
- VS Code (our recommended IDE)
- macOS, Linux, or Windows
- Expo Go installed on your physical device (Android or iOS)

These tools are essential for completing the upcoming projects efficiently.

## Why Expo Go?

Unlike web development, mobile development relies on device emulators to test applications. However, keeping up with the ever-evolving mobile ecosystem (e.g., iPhone 7 → iPhone 16 Pro Max, various Android devices) can be costly in terms of hardware requirements.

Expo Go provides a cost-effective solution by allowing you to test and run your React Native applications directly on your physical device, supporting both iOS and Android seamlessly.

## Setup Process

### Prerequisites

- Node.js LTS: Installed (version: v24.9.0)
- VS Code: Installed
- Operating System: Windows 11

### Installing Expo Go

1. Visited the official Expo Go homepage: https://expo.dev/go.
2. Selected the latest SDK version.
3. Clicked on Install for the device:
   - Android: Installed from the Google Play Store.
   - iOS: Installed from the Apple App Store.
4. Opened the Expo Go app on the device.
5. Created a new account or logged in if already having one.

### Testing the Setup

- [ ] Installed Expo Go successfully.
- [ ] Logged in or created account.
- [ ] Ready to proceed with React Native development using Expo.

## Challenges Faced

- No challenges encountered during the setup process.
- Ensure the device and computer are on the same network for testing apps via Expo Go.

## Notes

This setup allows for efficient mobile app development without the need for expensive emulators or multiple physical devices.
